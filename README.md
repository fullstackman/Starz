Starz
=====
The real list of my Github stars!

## Purpose
I like being able to star repositories on Github, but my list was getting out of hand. Plus, the list is only sorted by superficial properties like date added or language. I imported my stars into this repository so that I could list them by topic and see them all on one page.
