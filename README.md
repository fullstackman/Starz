Starz
=====
The real list of my Github stars!

## Purpose
I like being able to star repositories on Github, but my list was getting out of hand. Plus, the list has limited sorting options (date added, programming language, etc.). I imported my stars into this repository so that I could list them by topic and see them all on one page.
